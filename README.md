Culinary Calipers
=================

We built this for the Pluggd.in hackathon, and
it's been a work-in-progress since.

## Our Hunch

We feel the way restaurants are ranked now is
really more suited to machines. Restaurant
databases average out ratings from multiple
sources for a given restaurant. But when we,
humans, choose a place to eat, it's usually
a choice between a bunch of related restaurants, 
usually in the same neighbourhood or price range.
Restaurant databases will always rate a 5 star
hotel over the local dosa joint, but you don't
care about that. This is what we're trying to fix.

## The Prototype

We've built a [prototype](http://culinarycalipers.herokuapp.com)
to just collect data. You'll need to type in restaurant ID's from
[Zomato](http://www.zomato.com/) to compare and rate them.

An example triplet of ID's is: *5092,1212,3077*
